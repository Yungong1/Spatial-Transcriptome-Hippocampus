Novel Pathological Mechanisms Revealed by Spatial Transcriptomic Analysis of Hippocampus in Definite and Possible Primary Age-Related Tauopathy and Alzheimer’s Disease
=============================

## Overview
Welcome to the Spatial-Transcriptome-Hippocampus project! In this study, we generated a spatial transcriptomic atlas of the human hippocampus using six samples from individuals with definitive primary age-related tauopathy (dPART), possible PART (pPART), and Alzheimer’s disease (AD). The spatial transcriptome data was generated using 10X Genomics Visium. We have also generated one snRNA-seq data of hippocampus from one AD sample.

Thanks for your interest in our work!
